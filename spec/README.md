## Notation Conventions and Compliance

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the
[specification][] are to be interpreted as described in [BCP
14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14)
[[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)]
[[RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

An implementation of the [specification][] is not compliant if it fails to
satisfy one or more of the "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", or "SHALL
NOT" requirements defined in the [specification][]. Conversely, an
implementation of the [specification][] is compliant if it satisfies all the
"MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", and "SHALL NOT" requirements defined in
the [specification][].
