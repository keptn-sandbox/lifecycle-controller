# klt-cert-manager

The Keptn certificate manager ensures that the webhooks in the Lifecycle Toolkit operator can obtain a valid certificate
to access the Kubernetes API server.

## Description

This `klt-cert-manager` operator should only be installed when paired with the Lifecycle Toolkit operator versions 0.6.0
or above.
The TLS certificate is mounted as a volume in the LT operator pod and is renewed every 12 hours or every time the LT
operator deployment changes.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against.
You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for
testing, or run against a remote cluster.

> **Note**
Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever
cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/cert-manager:tag
```

1. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/cert-manager:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

### How it works

This project aims to follow the
Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the
cluster

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

1. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

> **Note**
You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

> **Note**
Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
