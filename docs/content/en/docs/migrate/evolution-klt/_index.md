The Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit uses a different paradigm
than that used for Keptn v1
and so migration from Keptn v1 will not be a straight-forward process.
In this section, we will assemble information to help people
who want to move from Keptn v1 as it becomes available.

> **Note**
This section is under development.
Information that is published here has been reviewed for technical accuracy
but the format and content is still evolving.
We hope you will contribute your experiences
and questions that you have.
