Keptn must be installed onto each Kubernetes cluster you want to monitor.
Additionally, Keptn needs to be enabled on your namespaces.
This will give you flexibility in how and where you want to use Keptn.

Keptn v0.9.0 and later is installed using [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

> **Note** Earlier releases could also be installed using the manifest.
> See
[Upgrade to Helm from a manifest installation](upgrade.md/#upgrade-to-helm-from-a-manifest-installation)
> if you need to upgrade from a manifest installation.

After you install Keptn, you are ready to
[Integrate Keptn with your applications](../implementing/integrate.md).

## Basic installation

Keptn is installed onto an existing Kubernetes cluster
using a Helm chart.
To modify the Keptn configuration,
you must modify the `values.yaml` file of the chart.

> **Note** Keptn works on virtually any type of Kubernetes cluster.
  See
  [Requirements](reqs.md)
  for specific requirements for your Kubernetes cluster.
>

The command sequence to fetch and install the latest release of Keptn is:

```shell
helm repo add keptn https://charts.lifecycle.keptn.sh
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install keptn keptn/keptn \
   -n keptn-system --create-namespace --wait
```

If you want to use Keptn to observe your deployments, you must enable Keptn in your
[Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)
via annotations.
For example, for the `testy-test` namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: testy-test
  annotations:
    keptn.sh/lifecycle-toolkit: "enabled" # this tells Keptn to watch the namespace
```

Some helpful hints:

* Use the `--version <version>` flag on the
  `helm upgrade --install` command to specify a different Keptn Helm chart version.

* Use the following command sequence to see a list of available versions:

  ```shell
  helm repo update
  helm search repo keptn --versions
  ```

* To verify that Keptn was installed in your cluster,
  run the following command:

  ```shell
  kubectl get pods -n keptn-system
  ```

  The output shows all Keptn components that are running on your cluster.

## Customizing the configuration of components

To modify configuration of the subcomponents of Keptn,
use the corresponding Helm values in your main `values.yaml`.
Use the subcomponent's parent value as the root for your configuration.

Here is an example `values.yaml` altering global and metrics operator values:

{{< docsembed path="content/en/docs/install/assets/values-advance-changes.yaml" >}}

### Modify Helm configuration options

Helm values can be modified before the installation.

To modify configuration options, download a copy of the
default `values.yaml` file,
modify some values, and use the modified file to install Keptn:

1. Download the `values.yaml` file:

   ```shell
   helm show values keptn/keptn > values.yaml
   ```

1. Edit your local copy to modify some values

1. Install Keptn by adding the following string to your `helm upgrade` command line:

   ```shell
   --values=values.yaml
   ```

You can also use the `--set` flag
to specify a value change for the `helm upgrade --install` command.
Configuration options are specified using the format:

```shell
--set key1=value1 \
--set key2=value2 ...
```

The [helm-chart](https://github.com/keptn/lifecycle-toolkit-charts/blob/main/charts/keptn/README.md) page
contains the full list of available values.

## Control what components are installed

Keptn consists of multiple components, each of which enables a specific use-case.
Each of the components is packaged into a subchart of Keptn which can be configured individually.

The following table summarizes the Keptn umbrella chart scheme:

| Component                                                                                                                  | Used for                                                                                                                  | Configuration file |

By default, all components are included when you install Keptn.
To specify the components that are included,
you need to modify the Keptn `values.yaml` file.

Note that the Keptn Helm chart is quite flexible.
You can install all Keptn components on your cluster,
then modify the configuration to exclude some components
and update your installation.
Conversely, you can exclude some components when you install Keptn
then later add them in.

### Disable Keptn Certificate Manager (Certificates)

If you wish to use your custom certificate manager,
you can disable Keptn `cert-manager` by setting the
`certificateManager.enabled` Helm value to `false`:

{{< docsembed path="content/en/docs/install/assets/values-remove-certmanager.yaml" >}}

For more information on using `cert-manager` with Keptn, see
[Use Keptn with cert-manager.io](../operate/cert-manager.md).

For the full list of Helm values, see the
[keptn-cert-manager Helm chart README](https://github.com/keptn/lifecycle-toolkit-charts/blob/main/charts/keptn-cert-manager/README.md).
