The Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit is meant to be installed
into an existing Kubernetes cluster
that runs your deployment software.
See [Requirements](../reqs) for information about supported releases
and advice about resources required.

You can also create a local cluster using packages
such as KinD, Minikube, K3s, and K3d
that can be used for testing, study, and demonstration purposes.
