## Keptn Task Definition

Keptn tasks are defined in a
[KeptnTaskDefinition](../yaml-crd-ref/taskdefinition/)
CRD.
A task definition includes a function
that defines the action taken by that task.
It can be configured in one of three different ways:

- inline
- referring to an HTTP script
- referring to another `KeptnTaskDefinition`

## Parameterized functions

`KeptnTaskDefinition`s can use input parameters.
Consider the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: lifecycle.keptn.sh/v1alpha2
kind: KeptnTaskDefinition
metadata:
  name: slack-notification-dev
spec:
  function:
    functionRef:
      name: slack-notification
    parameters:
      map:
        textMessage: "This is my configuration"
    secureParameters:
      secret: slack-token
```

Note the following about using parameters with functions:

- The Lifecycle Toolkit passes the values
  defined inside the `map` field as a JSON object.
- Multi-level maps are not currently supported.
- The JSON object can be read through the environment variable `DATA`
  using `Deno.env.get("DATA");`.

## Passing secrets to a function

In the previous example, you see that
Kubernetes
[secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)
can be passed to the function
using the `secureParameters` field.

Here, the `secret` value is the name of the Kubernetes secret,
which contains a field with the key `SECURE_DATA`.  
The value of that field is then available to the function's runtime
via an environment variable called `SECURE_DATA`.

For example, if you have a task function that should make use of secret data,
you must first ensure that the secret containing the `SECURE_DATA` key exists
For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: deno-demo-secret
  namespace: default
type: Opaque
data:
  SECURE_DATA: YmFyCg== # base64 encoded string, e.g. 'bar'
```

Then, you can make use of that secret as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: lifecycle.keptn.sh/v1alpha3
kind: KeptnTaskDefinition
metadata:
  name: deployment-hello
  namespace: "default"
spec:
  function:
    secureParameters:
      secret: deno-demo-secret
    inline:
      code: |
        console.log("Deployment Hello Task has been executed");

        let foo = Deno.env.get('SECURE_DATA');
        console.log(foo);
        Deno.exit(0);
```
