This section provides comprehensive reference information about the
[Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
that are defined for the Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit.

Each CRD is an object of an API library.
Keptn APIs follow the Kubernetes API versioning scheme.
and are themselves composed of objects and sub-objects.
By introducing CRDs, Keptn is extending the base Kubernetes API with new objects and functionality.
Keptn APIs follow API versioning conventions recommended by Kubernetes.
