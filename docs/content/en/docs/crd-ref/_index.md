This section provides comprehensive reference information about the
[Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
that are defined for the Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit.

**NOTE: This section is under development.
Information that is published here has been reviewed for technical accuracy
but the format and content is still evolving.
We welcome your input!**

Each CRD is an object of an API library.
Keptn APIs follow the Kubernetes API versioning scheme.
and is itself composed of objects and sub-objects.
