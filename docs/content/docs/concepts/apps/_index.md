An App contains information about all workloads and checks associated with an application.
It will use the following structure for the specification of the pre/post deployment and pre/post evaluations checks that should be executed at app level:

```
apiVersion: lifecycle.keptn.sh/v1alpha2
kind: KeptnApp
metadata:
name: podtato-head
namespace: podtato-kubectl
spec:
version: "1.3"
workloads:
- name: podtato-head-left-arm
version: 0.1.0
- name: podtato-head-left-leg
postDeploymentTasks:
- post-deployment-hello
preDeploymentEvaluations:    
- my-prometheus-definition
```
While changes in the workload version will affect only workload checks, a change in the app version will also cause a new execution of app level checks.
