# Documentation contributions

Keptn documentatation source is stored in the same repository
as Keptn software and test code
and is developed using the same practices used for software
and described in the
[General information](../general/index.md) section
of this *Contributing Guide*.

The pages in this section augment the "General" information
with information that is specific to the documentation:

- [Contribution guidelines for documentation](contrib-guidelines-docs.md)
  augments the general
  [Contribution Guidelines](../general/contrib-guidelines-gen.md
  with guidelines that are only relevant to documenation.
- [Build Documentation Locally](local-building.md)
  tells how to build the documentation locally
  so you can check the formatting, readability, and links
  in your local branch before you push the new content.
