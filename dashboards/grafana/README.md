# Grafana Dashboards for the Lifecycle Toolkit

This folder contains the Grafana dashboards for the Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit.

## Installing the dashboards

It is assumed, that there is a Grafana Instance available.
In our provided examples, the dashboards are automatically
provisioned.
If you want to install the dashboards manually, you can use the following steps:

```shell
# This defaults to http://localhost:3000, but can be changed by setting the GRAFANA_SCHEME, GRAFANA_URL and GRAFANA_PORT environment variable
# The default credentials are admin:admin, but can be changed by setting the GRAFANA_USERNAME and GRAFANA_PASSWORD environment variable
make install
```

## Changing the dashboards

The dashboards can be changed in the Grafana UI. 
To export dashboards,
follow these steps:

- Access your Grafana instance. 
- Open the dashboard you want to modify.  
- Click on the "Share" button located in the top toolbar.  
- From the dropdown menu, select "Export" to export the 
  dashboard as a JSON file.  
- Save the exported JSON file.

  and select "Dashboard" to create a new dashboard.

  Singlestat, Table, etc. 
  Each panel type has its own 
  configuration options.

  specifying the query, and customizing the visualization 
  settings as per your requirements.

  your dashboard.
- Customize the layout of your dashboard by dragging and 
  resizing panels.
